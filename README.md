### Project Idea

The Weather App provides real-time weather information for any city entered by the user. It fetches data from a weather API and displays:

- Weather icon based on current conditions
- Temperature in Celsius
- City name
- Humidity percentage
- Wind speed

The app features a clean and responsive UI, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
